# Questions:

This is just a mini-journal of questions I'm exploring or trying to remember.

- If we generate texts from a sampled KG, how do we determine "not enough information"? The subgraph might not have enough information, but it might be contained elsewhere.
- Is there a way to label the FEVEROUS dataset with a KG? This would be much easier than working from scratch.
    - We would have the FEVEROUS ground truths to help with the KG search for labeling
    - Are there other datasets where this would be possible?

**TO READ:**
- HybridQA: "a dataset consisting of multi-hop questions constructed by using Wikipedia tables and the introductory section of linked entities in the table"
- NaturalQA: table-based dataset

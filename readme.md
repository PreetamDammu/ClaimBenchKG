# ClaimBench - Dynamic QA Benchmarks

## Work in Progress (WIP)
This repository is under development and focuses on creating a robust framework for dynamic QA (Question and Answer) benchmarks. Below are the key highlights of the project:

### Features

- **Dynamic QA Benchmark Framework**
  - Utilizes the Yago knowledge graph for generating QA benchmarks.

- **Dynamic Splits**
  - Includes train/test/validation splits with dynamic capabilities to address memorization issues.

- **Steiner Trees**
  - Generates subgraphs and associates them with Q&A pairs and paths to the answer.

- **Control Over QA Generation**
  - Allows customization of the type and nature of QAs being generated.

### Why This Framework?
This project aims to simplify and enhance the generation of QA datasets for specific domains, such as:
- Cancer research
- US Policy
- Geography

The framework goes beyond traditional approaches by integrating intelligent algorithms and supporting diverse applications.

### Usage
TBD
